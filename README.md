React Advanced, final project - Front-end development at Winc Academy

This app is the final assignment in the Front-end development course at Winc Academy. 
The aim is to make an app for viewing, creating, editing, updating and deleting events. 

For this project I used:
- A mock API using JSON-server
- React Router to structure the pages within the app 
- React for the components
- Chakra UI for the styling of the app
